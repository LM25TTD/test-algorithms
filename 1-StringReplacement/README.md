# Problem: Replacing characters in place

# Description:

Given an array of characters, write a method to replace all the spaces with “&32”. You may assume that the array has sufficient slots at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the “true” length of the array. (Please perform this operation in place with no other auxiliary structure).

# Complexity

## Time complexity: 

The algorithm has only simple loops that depends on the entry size. Analysing this, it's time complexity is O(n).

## Space complexity: 

The amount of space required by algorithm is the size of entry (n) plus a constant k that is the quantity of whitespaces plus one. Analysing this, it's space complexity is O(n).

## Auxiliary space complexity:

There is no auxiliary space required to solve the problem, so the auxiliary space complexity is: O(1).
