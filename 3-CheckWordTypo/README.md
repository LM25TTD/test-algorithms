# Problem: Check words with typos

# Description:

There are three types of typos that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one typo (or zero typos) away.  


# Complexity

## Time complexity: 

The algorithm has only one simple loops that depends on the size of the biggest word. Therefore, it's time complexity is O(n).

## Space complexity: 

The amount of space required by algorithm is the size of entry (n). So, it's space complexity is O(n).

## Auxiliary space complexity:

There is no auxiliary space required to solve the problem, so the auxiliary space complexity is: O(1).
