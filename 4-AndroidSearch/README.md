# Problem: [Android] Search on a list

# Description:

Write an application with one activity that shows a list of items and a search box. The user expects that the search returns a result even if word typed is partially permuted or it has one typo (like explained on previous problems), but not both.


# Running

Open this project with Android Studio then Build and Run the application on any Android device.
