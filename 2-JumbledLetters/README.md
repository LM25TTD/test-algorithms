# Problem: Check words with jumbled letters

# Description:

Our brain can read texts even if letters are jumbled, like the following sentence: "Yuo cna porbalby raed tihs esaliy desptie teh msispeillgns." Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a partial­permutation of the other. Consider a partial­permutation only if: 
­
- The first letter hasn’t changed place 
- If word has more than 3 letters, up to 2/3 of the letters have changed place 


# Complexity

## Time complexity: 

The algorithm has only one simple loops that depends on the entry size. Therefore, it's time complexity is O(n).

## Space complexity: 

The amount of space required by algorithm is the size of entry (n). So, it's space complexity is O(n).

## Auxiliary space complexity:

There is no auxiliary space required to solve the problem, so the auxiliary space complexity is: O(1).
